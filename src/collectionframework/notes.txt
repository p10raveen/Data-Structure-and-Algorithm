Collection Framework
---------------------
1. Collection represents a single unit of objects i.e. a group.
2. Collections in java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
3. All the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, deletion etc. can be performed by Java Collections.
4. Methods of Collection interface
    1. add()
    2. addAll()
    3. remove()
    4. removeAll()
    5. retainAll()
    6. clear()
    7. size()
    8. contains()
    9. containsAll()

5. ArrayList class
    1. It is used to create Dynamic Array. so it doesn't require size.
    2. It allows Duplicate element
    3. It maintains Insertion order.

6. HashSet class
    1. It uses Hashtable to store elements.
    2. It uses hashing mechanism
    3. It maintains unordered collection.
    4. It does not allow duplicate elements.
    Example:
        Program3

7. LinkedHashSet class
    1. It uses LinkedList + Hashtable to store elements.
    3. It maintains ordered collection.
    4. It does not allow duplicate elements.
    Example:
        Program4

8. TreeSet class
    1. It uses Binary Tree to store elements.
    3. It stored elements in ascending order.
    4. It does not allow duplicate elements.
    Example:
        Program5

9. Map Interface
A Map contains values on the basis of key i.e. key and value pair.
Each key and value pair is known as an entry.
Map contains only unique keys.
Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of key.
Map.Entry Interface
Entry is the sub interface of Map. So we will be accessed it by Map.Entry ref_name
 It provides methods to get key and value.

10. HashMap class
A HashMap contains values based on the key.
It contains only unique elements.
It may have one null key and multiple null values.
It maintains no order.
Methods:
    Program6
    Program7
    Program8

11. TreeMap class
A TreeMap contains values based on the key.
It contains only unique elements.
It cannot have null key but can have multiple null values.
It maintains maintains ascending order
Examples
    Program9
    Program10
    Program11
