Tree DS
-------
1. Tree is a non-linear DS.
2. Tree consist of nodes connected by th edges.
3.IQ. Why we use tree DS?
    Inorder to perform any operations in a linear DS, the time complexity will
    increase when increase in data.
4. Terminology
        Node: A node is an entity that consist key/value and reference to its
        child nodes.
        Edge: It is a link between two nodes.
        Root: The top-most node of the tree.
        Tree Height: Height of tree is the height of the root node.
        Tree Depth: Depth of the deepest node is depth of the tree.

5. Binary Tree
   a. BT is a tree DS.
   b. Each parent node can have at-most two child nodes.
   c. Each node consist 3 parts:
        - reference to the left child
        - data/value
        - reference to the right child

   d. Types of BT:
        i. Full BT
            - Every node has either two or no child nodes.
            - It is aka Proper BT.

        ii. Perfect BT
            - Every internal nodes has exactly two child nodes and all the nodes are at the same level.

        iii. Complete BT
            - All the child nodes lean towards the left.


6. Tree Traversing
    Pre-order Tree Traversing  : Root->Left->Right
    In-Order Tree Traversing   : Left->Root->Right
    Post-order Tree Traversing : Left->Right->Root

7. Examples
    Program-1: Tree creation and traversing
    Program-2: Print the depth of Binary Tree
    Program-3: Count the number of nodes of the BT.
    Program-4: Check the BT is Full BT or not.
    Program-5: Check the BT is Complete BT or not
    HW: Program-6: Create the mirror image of BT


8. Binary Search Tree
----------------------
- BST is a tree data structure that allows to maintain a sorted tree.
- All the node of left sub-tree is less than the root node.
- All the node of right sub-tree is more than the root node.

    Program-7
        |- Insertion
        |- Deletion
