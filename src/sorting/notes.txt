Sorting
-------
1. The process of arranging elements or data in a specific order.
    |- ascending or descending order

2. Types of Sorting
    |- Bubble Sort:
           |- Compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
           |- It continues until the list is sorted.
           |- Program1

    |- Selection Sort:
        |- Finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and places it at the beginning.
        |- The algorithm then proceeds with the remaining unsorted part.
        |- Program2

    |- Insertion Sort:
        |- It builds the final sorted list one item at a time by inserting each element into its proper
            position within the sorted portion of the list.
        |- Program3

    |- Merge Sort:
        |- It follows the divide-and-conquer approach by repeatedly dividing the list into smaller sublists,
        |- sorting them independently, and then merging them back together.
        |- Program4

    |- Heap Sort:
        |- Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure
            to sort elements.
