Queue
-----
1. Queue is a Linear DS.
2. Queue follows FIFO principle [First-In-First-out].
3. Operations
        |- Enqueue : Insert an element into the Queue.
        |- Dequeue : Delete an element from the Queue.
4. All operations perform from two end points.
    |- FRONT -> Delete an element from the FRONT end.
    |- REAR  -> Insert an element from the REAR end.
5. Conditions
    a. FRONT = REAR == -1, Queue is Empty
    b. FRONT == REAR, Single Element
    c. REAR == SIZE-1, Queue is Full
6. Example
    Program1.java

Circular Queue
--------------
1. Circular Queue is a Linear DS.
2. Circular Queue follows FIFO principle [First-In-First-out].
3. Operations
        |- Enqueue : Insert an element into the Queue.
        |- Dequeue : Delete an element from the Queue.
4. All operations perform from two end points.
    |- FRONT -> Delete an element from the FRONT end.
    |- REAR  -> Insert an element from the REAR end.
5. Conditions
    a. FRONT = REAR == -1, CQ is empty
    b. FRONT == REAR, Single element in the CQ
    c. FRONT==0 && REAR == Size-1, CQ is full
    d. FRONT == REAR+1, CQ is Full
    e. REAR = (REAR+1) % Size
    f. FRONT = (FRONT+1)% Size
6. Example
    Program2

Deque [aka Double Ended Queue]
-----
1. Deque works on both ends
                    |- we can perform enqueue and dequeue from FRONT and REAR both.
2. We are using ArrayDeque class for these operations
3. ArrayDeque class is a generic class.
4. Methods:
    add()
    addFirst()
    addLast()
    offer()
    offerFirst()
    offerLast()
    remove()
    removeFirst()
    removeLast()
    getFirst()
    getLast()
    poll()
    pollFirst()
    pollLast()
