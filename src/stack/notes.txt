Stack
-----
1. It is a Linear DS.
2. It follows LIFO principle [Last In First Out].
3. Operations
    PUSH  -> Insert an element in the Stack.
    POP   -> Remove/Delete an element from a Stack.
    PEEK  -> Top most value in the stack.
4. All Operations of Stack DS work on the basis of TOP.
5. Conditions
    a. TOP == -1, Stack is Empty
    b. TOP == 0, Single element in the Stack
    c. TOP == Size-1, Stack is Full
    d. TOP == Size, Stack Overflow
6. Example
    Program1

7. Stack class
    1a. Stack class stored in java.util package.
    a. Stack class is a child class of Vector class.
    b. Stack class is a Synchronized class.
    c. Stack class also works on the basis of indexing.
    d. Stack class is a generic class.
    e. This Generic class use only Wrapper classes.
