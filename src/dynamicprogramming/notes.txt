Dynamic Programming
-------------------
1. It works on two approaches.
    i. Memoization  [recursion + store]
        |- Approach: Top-Down approach
    ii. Tabulation  [Iteration + store]
        |- Approach: Bottom-Up approach

Example
1. Fibonacci Without using DP
    Program1
2. Fibonacci With using DP (Top-Down approach)
    Program2
3. Fibonacci With using DP (Bottom-Up approach)
    Program3

HW4. factorial of a number using DP (Top-Down approach)
HW5. factorial of a number using DP (Bottom-Up approach)

6. Coin Change Problem
    Program6
    Given coin of different denomination and total amount. count the number of ways
    to make the amount
    Input:
        coins = [1,2,3]
        amount = 4
    Output:
            4
    Explain:
        1+1+1+1 = 4
        2+1+1   = 4
        2+2     = 4
        3+1     = 4

7. Coin Change Problem
    Program7
    Minimum coins to make amount
    Input:
        coins = [1,2,5]
        amount = 11
    Output:
            3
    Explain:
        5+5+1 = 11

HW8. Number of ways using Exact K coins
    Input:
        coin = [1,2]
        amount = 4
        K = 2
    Output:
            1
    Explain:
        1+1+1+1 = 4   NO
        1+1+2   = 4   NO
        2+2     = 4   YES


HW9. 0/1 Knapsack
    Input:
        Weights = [1,2,3]
        values = [6,10,12]
        capacity = 5

    Output: 22
    Explain:
            select 2 and 3, value 10 and 12 repectively, 22
