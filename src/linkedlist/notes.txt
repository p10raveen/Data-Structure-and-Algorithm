LinkedList (single LL)
----------
1. LL is similar to an Array.
2. LL elements access in linear way.
3. LL elements are not stored in contigious memory allocation (non-linear way).
4. Each element of LL is called a Node.
5. Each node of LL contains:
    |- Data - It holds the value of the node.
    |- Next - It holds the address/reference of the next node.
6. Last node of the LL contains NULL in the next part of the node.
7. Last node aka TAIL node.
8. Starting node of the LL is called HEAD node.
9. if the value of HEAD is equal to NULL then we can say that, LL is empty.

Examples:
    Program1
        Operations
            |- insertFirst
            |- insertLast
            |- deleteFirst
            |- deleteLast
            |- SearchElement
            |- HW: Count No of element of the LL
            |- HW: Count No of unique element of the LL (ignore duplicates)
            |- HW: Check the LL elements are in palindromic or not
            |- HW: Copy LL elements into another LL in InsertLast manner.
            |- HW: find the middle element of the LL.
            |- HW: insert an element at the middle of the LL.


Circular LinkedList (single LL)
-------------------
-> Head=Tail == null, CLL is empty
    Example:
        Program2.java
                Operations
                        |- insertFirst
                        |- insertLast
                        |- deleteFirst
                        |- deleteLast
                        |- HW: SearchElement
                        |- Count No of element of the LL
                        |- HW: Count No of unique element of the LL (ignore duplicates)
                        |- HW: Check the LL elements are in palindromic or not
                        |- HW: Copy LL elements into another LL in InsertLast manner.
                        |- HW: find the middle element of the LL.
                        |- HW: insert an element at the middle of the LL.
