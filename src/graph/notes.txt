Graph DS
--------
1. Graph is a non-linear DS.
2. Graph Consist vertices and edges.
3.
    V = {0,1,2,3,4}
    E - {(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(2,3),(2,4)}
    G = {V,E}
4. Categories
    |- Undirected Graph
        |- Graphs are represented by single line to show the connectivity of edges.
    |- Directed Graph
        |- Graphs are represented by arrows to show the connectivity of edges.
5. Types
    |- Simple/Acyclic Graph
    |- Cyclic Graph
    |- Weighted Graph
    |- Complete Graph

6. Programming representation of graph
    |- Adjacency Matrix (Sequential Representation)
    |- Adjacency List  (LinkedList Representation)


7. Adjacency Matrix

        0 - - - - -3
        | \       /
        |  \    /
        |   \ /
        1   2 ------- 4

     0   1   2   3   4
   ---------------------
0 |  0   1   1   1   0
1 |  1   0   0   0   0
2 |  1   0   0   1   1
3 |  1   0   1   0   0
4 |  0   0   1   0   0

8. Example
    Program-1: Create and print an adjacency matrix of undirected graph.
    Program-2: Create and print an adjacency matrix of directed graph.
    HW: Program-3: Check the Graph is Cyclic or not.
    HW: Program-4: Check the Graph is Complete or not.


9. Graph Traversing Technique

        |- Program3
    |- Breadth First Search [Queue]
        |- Program4

10. Spanning Tree
    |- ST is a sub graph of undirected connected graph.
    |- It include all the vertices with minimum number of edges.
    |- Is any vertex missed, then it is not ST.
    |- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) ***
        |- It used to find the ST from the Weight graph by check the minimum weight of the edges.
        |- To ensure, that no cycle in the MST
        |- There are two Algorithm for find the MST
            |- Prims Algorithm
                |- Program5
            |- Kruskal Algorithm
                |- HW: Program6

    |- Dijkrta Algorithm
            |- Program7

    |- Floyd Warshall Algorithm
            |- Program8
