Searching
----------
1. To search an element from the list.
2. There are mainly two searching algorithms:
    |- Linear Search
        - LS is a sequential searching algorithm
        - We start from one end and check every element of the list until the desired element is found.
        - Program1
    |- Binary Search
        - BS is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array.
        - if the elements are not sorted, we need to sort them first.
        - BS can be implemented in two ways:
            |- Iterative Method
                |- Program2
            |- Recursive Method
                |- Program3
